# Portfolio Builder
Portfolio Builder is a tool for building a stock portfolio. It provides functions for weighting and rebalancing.

## Motivation
I want the benefit of the passive investment strategies of ETFs without the disadvantage of fees. I created this program with the goal of copying and executing those strategies for free.

## Background
As of November 2020, the exchange traded fund (ETF) market is about $5 trillion, and the mutual fund market is about $21 trillion (source: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/us-etf-market-tops-5-trillion-in-assets-as-investors-stampede-into-stocks-on-vaccine-hopes.html). The average expense ratio for a fund in 2019 was 0.45% (source: https://newsroom.morningstar.com/newsroom/news-archive/press-release-details/2020/Morningstars-Annual-Fund-Fee-Study-Finds-Investors-Saved-Nearly-6-Billion-in-Fund-Fees-in-2019/default.aspx). Thus, the institutions that collectively manage $26 trillion of assets earn over $11 billion per year in fees.

With the ability to automate trades and purchase fractional shares, an investor can copy these ETFs without paying the fees. Let's get rid of unnecessary fees.
